# Prolog Engine

The Prolog Engine is designed to be a Prolog execution engine written in Rust. It implements the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM), which is the standard execution model for Prolog. Its goal is to provide an open-source, high-performance platform for running Prolog programs.

## Applications

### Prolog Development
If you want to develop or run Prolog code with optimizations like indexing, first argument indexing, and cut predicates, this is the go-to engine.

### Educational Tool
The project is useful for understanding how Prolog works under the hood and can be used in academic or experimental environments to explore Prolog execution strategies.

### Research
With its extensibility, it's aimed at researchers who want to experiment with logic and constraint programming by modifying or extending WAM-based systems.

### Industrial Strength
The project aims to be a robust environment for running Prolog-based applications in production settings.
